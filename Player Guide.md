# Gameplay Mechanics

## Movement
You can move in 4 directions, using the W/A/S/D buttons.

## Casting Spells
There are two classes of spells; Attack Mode spells and Crowd Control spells. To cast a spell, first a target must be selected by clicking on it. Then, to fire an attack, use the **space** bar (after selecting the desired attack mode) or **1/2/3/4**, and to fire a crowd control spell, press **z/x/c**.

## Attack Modes
Toggle between Attack Modes using the **tab** key, or by pressing **1/2/3/4** to select the desired Attack Mode. If an enemy is targetted when **1/2/3/4** is pressed, the attack will automatically fire off. Pressing the **space** key will fire off the currently selected Attack Mode's attack.

### Chaser
This mode is the "default" mode. It has average damage (30), but being in the Chaser mode grants additional movement speed.

### Agoniser
This mode provides the highest damage (50) of the attack modes.

### Stalker
This mode has lower damage (20) but allows for shooting any visible enemies, while other attack modes have a maximum cast range.

### Cascader
This mode has the lowest damage (15) of all attack modes, but allows for targetting of multiple enemies around the Area Of Effect (AOE) of the targetted enemy; it has the highest potential damage as a result.

## Advanced Spell Mechanics
### Target Switching
Attacks requiring Line of Sight (LOS Attacks) cannot be cast if the selected enemy is out of LOS. If an attack requiring line of sight is cast, and the enemy subsequently goes outside of the line of sight before the cast time, the spell will not be fired off. However, there is a way to get around that; if an enemy is clicked before the spell finishes casting, the target of the cast spell will change to that enemy. If an enemy is about to go out of sight, you can change target to another enemy so as not to waste the cast time.

### Animation Cancelling
Attacks have a trailing animation after the spell is cast, where the player returns to the idle position. It is possible to perform *Animation Cancelling*, by moving right after the attack is cast. Just be aware that you might accidentally cancel the attack if you move too early. Projectile attacks have more potential benefit from animation cancelling than Global/Point-Cast attacks, which finish casting nearer the end of the animation.
